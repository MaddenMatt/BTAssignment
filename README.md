## Import Project Into IntelliJ Idea

Intellij Idea has built-in support for Git so importing projects into the IDE is streamlined.  There are two different ways to import a repository from Git using IntelliJ Idea.

### Method One: Using the IntelliJ Idea Project Management Menu

#### 1. Open IntelliJ Idea and Access the Project Management Menu

Start IntelliJ Idea, if there is no project currently open in ItelliJ Idea then the project management menu will open by default.  If you currently have a project open, the project management menu can be opened by clicking File -> Close Project.  The project that was open in the IDE will also be available to open from the project management menu if you wish to reopen it.  An image of the project management page is displayed below.

#### 2. Use IntelliJ Idea's Git Support to Import the Project

In the project management menu click on Check out from Version Control -> Git.

A dialog box will open and ask you for the Git URL to the repository and the path to the directory that you would like to clone the repository to.
